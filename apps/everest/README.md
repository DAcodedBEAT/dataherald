# Everest

Project Everest is a growth experiment with the end goal of generating leads via a public-facing demonstration of DHAI’s capabilities

The “real goal” for this project is to “manually automate” the process of creating content at scale. Once the concept is validated, our product team can systematically develop automated solutions for the most time-consuming aspects of the project
